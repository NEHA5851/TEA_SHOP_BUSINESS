## 🔍 Key SQL Queries

The project includes 10 analytical queries:

1. **Total revenue** across all branches.
2. **Top 5 most sold tea products**.
3. Orders placed in a branch with **ZIP code `700001`**.
4. **Total number of orders per branch** (city-wise).
5. **Employee with the most handled orders**.
6. **Average quantity** ordered per order.
7. **Recent orders** (last 7 days).
8. **Customers who ordered more than 5 times**.
9. **Revenue generated by each product**.
10. **Total orders handled by employee roles** (e.g., Manager, Salesperson).

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Import the `tea_shop_business_code.sql.sql` script into your SQL database.
2. Execute the schema creation commands first (ensure foreign keys are respected).
3. Run the analytical queries to get business insights.
4. Use the ER diagram (`schema_tea_shop.png`) as a reference for table relationships.
